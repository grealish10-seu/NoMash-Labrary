Deployment using VueJS is very simple, it will take you less than 30 minutes to do it. 

Please remember this is due to the nature of the vue is front-end framework, deployment with a server backend requires a much longer time (if you are not experienced, can take a whole day at least) as you need to install and configure relevant server available. (For example, Apache web server to run PHP, MariaDB/ MySQL server to run database)

Please note your Git project that you try to deploy shall only contain one project, if you contain multiple project, then the deployment can fail
